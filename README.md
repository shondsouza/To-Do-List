# To-Do List Web App

This is a simple To-Do List web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add, complete, delete tasks, and saves tasks locally using `localStorage`.

### Features:
1. **Add Tasks**: Enter tasks in the input box and click "Add Task" or press `Enter`.
2. **Mark Tasks as Completed**: Toggle a checkbox to mark tasks as complete or incomplete.
3. **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks using the "Delete" button.
4. **Persistent Storage**: Tasks are stored in `localStorage` and will persist even after refreshing the page.
5. **Responsive Design**: Adjusts layout for various screen sizes.

### How It Works:
- **Task Creation**: Adds tasks with a unique `id` and displays them in the list.
- **Task Completion**: Toggles the task's completed state and updates its appearance.
- **Task Deletion**: Removes tasks from the list and updates `localStorage`.
- **Empty Message**: Displays a message if there are no tasks.
